        <p className="text-slate-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Gijzenrooi is known for its gentle pace and green surroundings—quiet streets, family-friendly paths, and open spaces that invite you to walk, cycle and breathe. Excellent schools, playgrounds and local amenities sit close by, while the heart of Eindhoven is an easy connection away. Here, weekends feel unhurried and daily life simply works.

          A day in this home begins with soft morning light in the kitchen, coffee from the local bakery, and school just a short cycle through leafy streets. Afternoons unfold in the conservatory, children drifting between inside and out. As the sun turns west, the garden glows—dinner on the terrace, golden light in the trees, a gentle sense that you are exactly where you want to be.
